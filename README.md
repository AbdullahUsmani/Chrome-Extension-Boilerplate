# Chrome Extension Boilerplate
Chrome Extension Boilerplate with React, Tailwind, Webpack

## Steps to setup:
Clone the repo, open terminal in the project folder and run: 
```sh
npm install
```
To build for production, run:
```sh
npm run build
```
This will create a _'dist'_ folder in the root directory which will have the bundled files. Then add the extension to Chrome from the _'dist'_ directory.

(optional) During development, run the following command to watch and recompile whenever a file changes:
```sh
npm run dev
```
